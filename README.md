# SQL-Sale-Analysis
In MySQL, I cleaned the data by removing duplicate rows, removing null or blank values, standarizing the data, creating new columns, and creating new tables.
This included creating a database, changing datatypes, updating tables, ect.  

I analyzed the dataset to verify information for the sales powerBI dashboard.  The information looked at was sales data and KPIs.
